## 📝 Project Description
TriCalc is a modern, single-page web application designed to help triathletes accurately calculate and estimate their total race time. Simply input your distances and either your pace/speed or total time for each segment (Swim, Bike, Run, T1, T2), and TriCalc instantly delivers your cumulative race time.

Built with a sleek, tech-focused dark mode aesthetic, this tool was deliberately **vibe coded** using only pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript to ensure maximum speed and zero dependency bloat.

## ✨ Features

* **Bi-Directional Calculation:** Input Pace/Speed to get Time, or input Time to get Pace/Speed.
* **Unit Toggle:** Instantly switch between Metric (km/m) and Imperial (miles/yards) units.
* **Pre-set Distances:** Quickly load standard race distances (Sprint, Olympic, Half IM, Full IM).
* **Customization:** All distances are editable for non-standard races.
* **Theme Switcher:** Toggle between default Dark Mode and a high-contrast Light Mode.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for mobile and desktop viewing.
